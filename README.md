# Diamond valuation project
 There is a dataset containing almost 50,000 records about different diamonds including their price. “Cut” is described from “fair” to “ideal” and reflects the quality of diamond cut. There are two other categorical properties describing diamonds color and clarity. The goal is to build a diamond price predictive model.
